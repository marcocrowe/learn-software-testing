Example 4 – A software system to accept new stock items in a timber yard accepts the item name followed by a list of different lengths the item comes in. The specification states that the item name is to be alphabetic 5 to 10 characters long. Each length in meters must be in the range of 1 to 7, whole numbers only. The lengths are to be entered in descending order (biggest length first) with a maximum of 3 lengths allowed to be entered for each item. A comma is to be used to separate the item name from the lengths and a comma will be used to separate each length and the enter key to be pressed after last length is entered.  

Derive the equivalence classes and determine black box test cases based on these and use boundary value analysis.  

Example 5 

In a system designed to work out the tax to be paid the following is the specification:

An employee had €400 tax free, the next €1500 is taxed at 10% tax, the next €28000 is taxed at 22%  tax and any further amount is taxed at 40% tax. The system takes as input the annual salary amount and outputs the amount of tax paid.

Derive the equivalence classes and determine black box test cases based on these and use boundary value analysis.
